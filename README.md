               Hello Pose user! This message is for you!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


   1 - Make sure you disconnect from your R session on Pose by using quit() and/or by disconnecting from the server


   2 - Monitor Pose usage with "htop" or "top -o %MEM"


   3 - Monitor disk usage with "df -h"


   4 - If some of your processes are running for no reason (as seen in "top" or "htop"), kill yourself on Pose with "pkill -u username". This will kill all processes started by you. Just reconnect after and verify that the processes are killed with "htop"


   Many thanks!
